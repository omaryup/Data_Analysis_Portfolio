- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, and welcome!
- :dart: This is a portfolio created to display my technical and visualization skills on Python, SQL and more.
- The "Financial_Data.py" file shows a quick program I wrote to obtain financial data from yahoo finance using Python, pandas, matplotlib, numpy and more.
-   The intention is for user to enter a valid ticker (verified by a function that only accepts alphabetical characters)
-   Followed with user input for start and end date (user must follow the Y-M-D format)
-   Additionally, the program will create a DataFrame for the first 10 rows of data obtained and perform two quick calculations based on adjusted return
-     simple return is then calculated using numpy (as percentage change)
-     then, log return is calculated using numpy as the division between adj_close and prior adj_close values
-   The program then will continue output major holders for the ticker/stock followed by line charts for all values in DataFrame
-   The program will also create plots for the new columns created (simple return and log return)
-   For visualization purposes, some additional items are printed at the end
-   as of 10/19/21 this program is still in progress.
